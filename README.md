# Pet Project for Advanced Software Engineering WS 2019/20
This Pet project was inspired by a tic tac toe game from this particular website <https://inventwithpython.com/chapter10.html>. It is based on a simple model and the evaluation of human kind playing this game over the time. Thus the turn of computer follows this findings. In this documentation I will show UML diagrams and some metrics for the code, as well as some clean code concepts.

# UML Diagrams
Starting with UML diagrams. I created three of them, one for the game flow, one for sequences and the final one for use cases.

## sequence

## use case

# Metrics
Using sonarqube I could improve the code quality. One can see the changed code in the following Link.

[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=knschuckmann_pet_project&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=knschuckmann_pet_project)

# Travis CI
Continious Integration is allways usefull. In this particular case it was used for training purposes. Usually it is common to use CI tools in Teams, so the contributing developers allways know weather the development is fine and works or not.

# Code Climate
Improved code climate from F to D

[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/883bec08099168100c99/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/knschuckmann/pet_project/maintainability)
# Clean Code
My clean code principles are based on the 'clean code cheat sheet', which can be found here: [Link](https://www.planetgeek.ch/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Clean-Code-V2.2.pdf)

[[Example 1]](https://github.com/knschuckmann/pet_project/blob/master/play.py#L35) General and Understandability

[[Example 2]](https://github.com/knschuckmann/pet_project/blob/master/TicTacToe_Game.py#L12) Class Design

[[Example 3]](https://github.com/knschuckmann/pet_project/blob/master/play.py) KISS (keep it simple, stupid)

[[Example 4]](https://github.com/knschuckmann/pet_project/blob/master/play.py) DRY (dont repeat yourself)

[[Example 5]](https://github.com/knschuckmann/pet_project/blob/master/TicTacToe_Game.py#L64) Methods

# IDE Shortcuts

I am using Spyder IDE. Since it comes with Anaconda it is very distributed even though the funding stoped recently. Thus threre was an update to Spyder 4.0 so even though the funding stopped, the development of Spyder IDE continues.

My favourite Shortcuts are:


# Dsl

# Functional Programing 
[functions as parameters and return values]()
